## Day Trading Plan for 1-2% Daily Gain with one Trade
  - Makret Selection: Choose a liqui, volatile market like major stocks, EFS with sufficient daily movement.
  - Timeframe Selection: User a short timeframe chart like 5-minute or 15-minute for precise entry and exit.
  - Single Clear Entry Signal: Use simple technical indicators - such as moving average crossover (like 10-period SMA crossing above/below a 30-period SMA) combined with confirmation from an oscillator like the MACO or RSI to confirm momentum direction.
  - Enter Criteria: Enter a long or short position when the price breaks a recent high (for long) or low (for short) confirmed by your indicators signaling momentum.
  - Risk Management: Set a tight stop-loss around .05%-1% below/above your entry price to limit losses on the single trade.
  - Profit Target: Set a take-profit level at 1-2% above/below the entry price. Once the price reaches this level, exit immediatly to lock in the gain.
  - Execution and Discipline: Enter your one trade for the day only when your criteria are met and stick to your stop-loss and profit target rigidly, avoiding emotional or implusive decisions.
  - Avoid Overtrading: If no clear setup occurs that meets your criteria, skip trading for the day rather than forcing a trade.
