# **Strategy**
## **Day Trading Plan for 1-2% Daily Gain with one Trade**
  - **Makret Selection**: Choose a liqui, volatile market like major stocks, EFS with sufficient daily movement.
  - **Timeframe Selection**: User a short timeframe chart like 5-minute or 15-minute for precise entry and exit.
  - **Single Clear Entry Signal**: Use simple technical indicators - such as moving average crossover (like 10-period SMA crossing above/below a 30-period SMA) combined with confirmation from an oscillator like the MACO or RSI to confirm momentum direction.
  - **Enter Criteria**: Enter a long or short position when the price breaks a recent high (for long) or low (for short) confirmed by your indicators signaling momentum.
  - **Risk Management**: Set a tight stop-loss around .05%-1% below/above your entry price to limit losses on the single trade.
  - **Profit Target**: Set a take-profit level at 1-2% above/below the entry price. Once the price reaches this level, exit immediatly to lock in the gain.
  - **Execution and Discipline**: Enter your one trade for the day only when your criteria are met and stick to your stop-loss and profit target rigidly, avoiding emotional or implusive decisions.
  - **Avoid Overtrading**: If no clear setup occurs that meets your criteria, skip trading for the day rather than forcing a trade.

## **Example Single-Trade Day Trading Plan**
1. **Char and Market Setup**
    - Use a liquid and volatile instrument (ex, avuv, vti, qqq )
    - Select a 5-munite candlestick chart for better intraday resolution. 
2. **Key Indicators**
    - Use two indicators for simplicity:
        - 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
        - Relative Strength Index (RSI), set to 14-period.
3. **Defining Trend**
	- If price is above the 21 EMA, look only for **long** (buy) trades.
	- If price is below the 21 EMA, look only for **short** (sell) trades. 
    
4. **Setup and Entry Criteria**
	- **For a LONG Trade**:
        - Wait for price to pull back toward the 21 EMA but not close below it.
        - Enter when a bullish candlestick closes above the 21 EMA and RSI is above 50 (showing upward momentum)
	- **For a SHORT Trade**: 
		- Wait fr price to pull back up toward the 21 EMA but not close above it. 
		- Enter when a bearish candlestick closes below the 21 EMA and RSI is below 50. 
5. **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**
	- Place a stop-loss 0.5% below your entry (long) or .5% above (short), or at the most recent swing low/high.
	- Set a fixed take-profit at 1% or 2% above (long) or 0.5 above (short), or below (short) your entry.
6. **Simple Execution Checklist**
	- Confirm trend direction (relative to 21 EMA).
	- Confirm pullback near the EMA. 
	- Wait for confirmation (RSI and candle close).
	- Enter trade and set both stop-loss and take-profit orders immediatly.
	- No additional trades for the day -- even if you miss the chance. 
7. **Record-Keeping**
	- Log each trade outcome, noting if you stuck to your rules.
	- Review weekly for adherence to the plan, not just profit/loss. 

## **Example (LONG) Trade Walkthrough**
	- Instrument: VOO ETF 5-min chart
	- Price is above 21 EMA; trend is up.
	- Price pulls back, touches 21 EMA, forms bullish engulfing candle that closes above EMA.
	- RSI is at 53 (above 50) at candle close.
	- Enter long at $100.00
	- Set stop-loss: $99.50 (.5% risk).
	- Set take-profit: $101.00 (1% gain).
	- Trade triggers and closes at stop or traget: You don't enter another trade that day, regardless of the outcome.

## **Why this works**
	- The approach is simple, disciplined, and minimizes noise/trading fatigue. 
	- You leverage trend-following for higher probability moves and use clearly defined indicators for timing. 
	- It is easily testable, repeatable, and can be adapted to your preferred instruments or indicators.
