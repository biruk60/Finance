The LCE model in support and resistance trading stands for a simple, rule-based approach: Level-to-Level, Clarity, and Execution. In this context, it emphasizes trading from one clearly defined price level (support or resistance) to the next, using a structured and repeatable process to make decisions quickly and consistently��.What Is the LCE Model?Level-to-Level: Focus only on trading from one known support to the next resistance (or vice versa), rather than predicting erratic price moves between levels.Clarity: The strategy should be distilled to a few rules—ask: "Will price revisit the previous support/resistance or target the next level?"Execution: Once price hits your predefined level, immediately execute the trade if confirmation aligns, reducing indecision and emotional hesitation��.Scenario: Using Support and Resistance StrategySuppose you notice QQQ approaching a clear support at $370. You expect a potential bounce. Here’s a step-by-step walk-through:Set a price alert at $370 within Thinkorswim by right-clicking on the chart at the $370 line and selecting “Create alert.” Adjust specifics in the alert window, and choose your desired notification���.When triggered, observe the price action at $370—does it show a bullish candlestick reversal? If yes, that’s your basic confirmation to consider an entry.Enter a long trade aiming for the next clear resistance, say, $375.Place your stop-loss a bit below the support (e.g., $368) to manage risk.Supplementary ConfirmationsSupport and resistance work best when combined with other signals:Volume Spike: Confirmation is stronger if volume increases as price tests support/resistance��.Price Action Patterns: Look for candlestick reversals like hammers, engulfing candles, or pin bars near your level�.Momentum/Trend Tools: Use RSI for divergence, moving average crossovers for trends, or check for alignment across multiple timeframes (daily, 1h, 15min) for more reliability��.Market Context: Confirm that the prevailing trend supports your trade idea; avoid trading against dominant moves without solid justification��.Using ThinkorswimRight-click the desired price area on the chart and select "Create alert."Customize notification settings and adjust price as needed.Review all active alerts from the "MarketWatch" tab to keep organized���.Combining LCE logic with solid confirmation tools and alerting in Thinkorswim provides a simple, repeatable, and controlled support/resistance trading workflow���




Here’s a step-by-step guide to set price alerts for any level in ThinkorSwim:Step-by-Step: Creating Price AlertsRight-Click ChartOn the chart for your stock or ETF, right-click at the price level where you want to set your alert���.Select “Create Alert”In the context menu, click “Create Alert” or “Create alert…”���.Configure Alert DetailsA window pops up. Here, you can adjust:The symbol (stock/ETF)The alert type (last price, bid, ask, mark)The price threshold (“at,” “at or above,” “at or below”)��Sound or notifications (email, push, etc.) if set up in notifications settings�.Set Your Price LevelEdit the price to match your target support or resistance level if needed��.Add Notes (Optional)Add a note or label for the alert, e.g., “Watch for bounce at $370”�.Create the AlertClick “Create” at the bottom of the window to confirm���.Viewing & Managing AlertsTo view or edit active alerts, go to the “MarketWatch” tab and select “Alerts.”You can manage, modify, or delete existing alerts from this screen easily��.Notifications Setup (Optional but Recommended)To get email or text alerts: Go to thinkorswim settings (gear icon > Application Settings > Notifications), and enter your contact information, then enable “Alert is triggered” notifications�.You can repeat these steps for as many price levels as needed on the same chart or across multiple tickers��.

The LCE model stands for Level, Confirmation, and Execution—a step-by-step discretionary trading process where you first identify a key price level, then confirm the trade setup using another signal or indicator, before finally executing your trade. Support and resistance levels are typically determined by visually finding significant price turning points on your chosen timeframe, and the timeframe you select depends heavily on whether you trade intraday or swing styles.LCE Model with Confirmation IndicatorLevel: First, identify a clear supply (resistance) or demand (support) zone. This is often where price previously reversed or paused several times. Higher timeframes (like daily or 1-hour) provide more robust key levels since these reflect consensus among more traders and institutions��.Confirmation: Wait for a confirmation signal before entering. This could include:A candlestick reversal pattern at the level.A technical indicator confirmation, such as RSI moving above 30 (for potential long) or below 70 (for potential short), or a moving average crossover at the zone.A volume spike confirming the relevance of the level.Execution: Enter the trade (buy or sell) only when your confirmation criteria are met and manage risk using stop-loss below/above the zone���.How to Set Support and Resistance LevelsLook for significant swing highs and lows—the more times price has reacted at a price, the stronger the level�.Draw horizontal lines or zones across these points using your charting platform. The line is more reliable if it captures multiple reactions.Treat these not as precise lines but as "zones"—sometimes price will overshoot slightly before respecting the level.Always confirm the validity by observing how price reacts on approaches to the zone: did price bounce multiple times or consolidate around it��?Which Time Frame to Use?Higher Timeframes (Daily, 4H, 1H): Levels are stronger and more reliable, used more for swing trading or establishing primary zones even for intraday strategies��.Intraday Timeframes (15-min, 5-min, 1-min): For scalping or day trading, use these to refine your entries but always view higher timeframe levels first; major reactions tend to happen there���.Many traders set alerts on key levels from the daily or 1-hour chart to capture when price enters those “major reaction zones,” then monitor for confirmation on a lower timeframe (like 5-15 min) for precise entries��.Setting AlertsMost platforms allow you to right-click on a drawn support/resistance line (or enter a specific price) to set an alert.Choose to be notified if price crosses, touches, or nears the key level, then wait for confirmation on your smaller entry timeframe before acting.For the LCE method, use higher timeframes (1 hour or daily) to set strong levels, add alerts, and then drop to a lower timeframe (15-min, 5-min, even 1-min) for entry confirmation and trade execution.

Using the LCE (Level-Confirmation-Execution) framework with the 9 EMA, RSI, and price action is a solid, widely adopted combination—especially for short-term and intraday strategies. These indicators support each other by filtering noise, confirming trend direction, and pinpointing high-probability entries.Effectiveness of 9 EMA, RSI, and Price Action9 EMA: The 9-period Exponential Moving Average reacts quickly to price changes and gives reliable short-term trend cues. Many traders use a price crossover above/below the 9 EMA as a trigger signal, but this is much stronger when aligned with other evidence���.RSI (Relative Strength Index): Using the RSI (e.g., overbought/oversold levels, bullish/bearish divergences) helps avoid false 9 EMA signals by confirming underlying momentum. For example, a long entry is higher probability if price crosses above the 9 EMA, and RSI is moving up but not yet in overbought territory��.Price Action: Confirm with candlestick patterns—such as bullish/bearish engulfing, pin bars, or strong volume breakouts at key levels—which can add another layer of validation to your setup. Support and resistance zone reactions, and the quality of the breakout candle, are crucial price action cues�.Best Practices and LimitationsThis trifecta covers trend, momentum, and actual market sentiment, significantly minimizing false entries caused by using any single indicator alone��.Many experienced traders recommend adding volume analysis for even more robust breakouts, as increasing volume alongside these signals reduces the odds of whipsaws�.No signal set is perfect—always apply strict risk management (stop-loss, position sizing) since the 9 EMA is fast and sometimes yields false signals in choppy conditions��.Backtest this approach on your instrument and timeframe before committing significant capital, as performance can vary by market volatility��.Used together within the LCE method, 9 EMA, RSI, and price action provide a solid and well-validated setup for trade entries—especially when confirmed at key support or resistance zones with mindful risk management���.

To set both a stop loss and a price target (take profit) for a buy position in ThinkorSwim, you typically use a bracket order called an OCO (One Cancels the Other) order. This allows you to manage risk and automate your exit based on either your profit goal or maximum acceptable loss.Step-by-Step Walkthrough Example1. Start a New Buy OrderFrom the chart, right-click where you want to buy the stock, then select “Buy custom” → “With OCO Bracket.” This automatically sets up fields for an entry, a stop loss, and a profit target order���.2. Configure Order ParametersThe order ticket appears at the bottom of your screen. You’ll see three rows: the buy order, your sell limit (take profit), and your sell stop (stop loss).Example scenario:Current stock price: $100.You want to buy 10 shares.Price target (take profit): $110.Stop loss: $95.3. Set Price TargetIn the “Sell Limit” row, enter your profit target price ($110 in the example)��.This will create a limit sell order that executes if price rises to $110.4. Set Stop LossIn the “Sell Stop” row, set the stop price ($95 in the example). This order will trigger if price falls to $95 or lower��.You can choose “STOP” (market order when triggered) or “STOP LIMIT” (triggers a limit order at your specified price; safer in volatile conditions)�.5. Review and SendDouble-check quantity, prices, and order type.Click “Confirm and Send.” Your order is now active as a bracket. If either the target or stop hits first, ThinkorSwim cancels the other order automatically to prevent double execution��.Tip: OCO Bracket ManagementMonitor your order status via the “Monitor” tab—open orders will be visible.You can adjust the bracket on-the-fly (drag lines on the chart) if your strategy or market conditions change.This method gives you strong risk management and automation, making it easy to execute and manage trades efficiently in ThinkorSwim
